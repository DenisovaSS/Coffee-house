# Coffee House

## Project's Description

Coffee House is a project where you will need to create a website consisting of two pages, make it responsive, and add interactivity.

## Key skills

- Valid semantic responsive web design;
- Easy-to-maintain readable code;
- Exporting styles and graphics from Figma;
- Using JavaScript to implement the functionality specified in the task.

## Project Work Stages

The task consists of three parts:

- [Coffee-House. Week-1: Fixed Layout](coffee-house-week1.md)
  - In this part of the task, you need to create the 'Home' and 'Menu' pages based on the layout, which should display correctly when the window width is at least 1440px;
  - The validity of the work is checked, as well as its compliance with the layout.
- [Coffee-House. Week-2: Responsive Design](coffee-house-week2.md)
  - In this part of the task, it is necessary to add responsiveness to the pages created in the first stage, up to and including a width of 380px;
  - The validity of the work is checked, its alignment with the layout at the corresponding page width, layout responsiveness, and the absence of horizontal scroll bars.
- [Coffee-House. Week-3: Adding Functionality](coffee-house-week3.md)
  - In this part of the task, we use JavaScript to add interactivity to the pages;
  - The implemented functionality is being checked.
